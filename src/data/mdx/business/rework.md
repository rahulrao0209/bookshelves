Rework is a unique business book which shows the reader a better, faster, easier way to be successful in business. The book tells the reader why plans are truly harmful, why people don't need outside investors and why a person is better ignoring the competition.

The book tells the reader what you really need to be successful which is to stop talking and start working. This book shows the reader the right way. It teaches the reader how to be more creative, how to get exposure without wasting money and tons of other senseless thoughts that will motivate and provoke the reader.

Its straightforward language and easy approach makes ‘Rework’ the perfect playbook for anyone who’s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Committed businesspersons, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs they hate, victims of "rationalizing," and artists who don’t want to famish anymore will all find valuable guidance in these pages. The book is easily available in its paperback format on Amazon
