Are you finding it tough to fund your start-up? Especially in the post-COVID-19 world, where money is scarce? Well, then, this book is for you.
It takes you through stories of early-stage start-ups and how they successfully managed to raise funding. Even better, it takes you through stories of failures-start-ups that couldn't raise funding, and why. After all, you can learn as much from failures as you can from successes.
<br/>
The authors also inter view some of the most accomplished founders in the world of business, such as Deep Kalra of
MakeMyTrip, Yashish Dahiya of PolicyBazaar, Dinesh Agarwal of IndiaMART and Sairee Chahal of SHEROES. Their stories
all come together in a useful 'PERSISTENT' framework, which helps make a start-up investment-ready.
