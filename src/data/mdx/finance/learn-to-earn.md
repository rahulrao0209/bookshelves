Learn to Earn - A Beginner's Guide to The Basics of Investing and Business was written to fulfill two reasons, one was to make sure that the 'rich get richer, poor get poorer' principle doesn't dwell in business for long. The second reason was to let the common people make a living out of associating with the brands they use every day.

Almost every second teenager wears a Nike product to a basketball game. Three out of five families stop at a McDonalds for lunch during a road trip. Nestle is much more than just a household name. and State Bank of India holds the largest number of savings bank accounts in the country. Yet, how many of these customers are investing in their relationships with these brands? More importantly, how many are aware that they can? This book is for those who are not making use of this.

Not only do the authors, Lynch and Rothchild, explain that you don't have to know it all to make it big in business but they also go a step ahead and tell you how to earn out of every sip of Coca Cola you swallow. Learn to Earn - A Beginner's Guide to The Basics of Investing and Business is not just a guide to the basics of investing and business but it is also a guide to setting your own milestones. The book also tells you the best ways of achieving these milestones. This book was published by Simon and Schuster in 1996 and is available in paperback.
