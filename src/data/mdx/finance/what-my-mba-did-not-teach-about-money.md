How we "think" about money is very different from how we "feel" about it. While separating the two on paper is easy, sticking to budgets, having financial conversations, calculating risk & reward, following investment plans, and preserving wealth is often challenging. This is why personal finance is so hard and making money decisions so tough.
<br/>
What My MBA Did Not Teach Me About Money gives real and practical strategies to work around:
<br/>

1. Money beliefs
<br/>

2. Hiccups in finance
<br/>

3. Navigating stock markets
<br/>

4. Overcoming our own biases 
<br/>

5. Navigating our vulnerabilities in those special situations when we are most likely to make money mistakes
<br/>

Each of the strategies presented in the book is derived from practical experiences of the authorsâ€™ own lives and from advising their clients. This book is about bridging the gap between the "feeling" human perspective and the "thinking" financial perspective of money.
