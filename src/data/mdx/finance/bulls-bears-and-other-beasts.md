The wise, wily Lalchand Gupta takes you on an exciting journey through Dalal Street in this brief history of the Indian stock market post liberalization. From tech booms and tax evasion to banks and money laundering; scams and crashes to fixers and investors, Lala has seen it all. A comprehensive account of the stock market over the last 25 years, it tells you what to watch out for while investing. It also looks at policies that the government needs to revise if the country is to harness domestic capital more effectively. Bulls, Bears and Other Beasts is a must-read for all interested in the financial health of the country as well as those who want to know about the sensational events that led up to the far more sterile stock-market operations of the present day.
