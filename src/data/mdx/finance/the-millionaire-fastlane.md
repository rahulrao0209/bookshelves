There is a Fastlane to making millions, a shortcut paved by Mathematics, were you can live rich now, versus dying rich later! Mainstream financial gurus hoodwink you into believing that wealth can be created by recklessly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the stock market, The job market, and the housing market. They propagate a dream-stealing, soul-sucking dogma known as “get rich slow”, which dubiously promises “wealth-in-a-wheelchair”―leading you to sacrifice your youth for a financial plan that reaps dividends only in life’s Twilight. If you accept this “slowly” as your blueprint for wealth, your financial future will drift carelessly on a sailboat of “hope and pray”. for those who don’t want a lifetime subscription to mediocrity and a path to elderly riches, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any other roads out there. Switch lanes, go fastball, and win financial freedom young, not old. This powerful book will teach you: why “wealth-in-wheelchair”, 40 year jobs, retirement plans, indexed-funds, mindless frugality and other “financial guru-speak” strategies will never make you rich. Why most “get rich” books only make the authors rich―not you! How to truly feel wealthy now, even if you’re flat broke. The 5 wealth commandments―how to create a millionaire-making income! The #1 leading cause of poorness―start here and you can change everything! How you can make NET worth explosions of 400% or more; say goodbye to paltry 8% stock market returns! Why the Guru nonsense of “do what you love”, “follow your passion” and other feel-good platitudes are most likely only dead end roads to wealth. And over 250 poverty-busting, wealth-accelerating distinctions!.
