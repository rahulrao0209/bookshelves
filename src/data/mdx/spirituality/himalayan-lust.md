Every year, a group of Isha meditators sets out on a tour of the Himalayas. Accompanying them on this journey is Sad guru -a spiritual master considered by many to be one of the foremost living yogis on the planet. This is a book for those who stayed behind. It is a chance to make a pilgrimage on the page, travelling through the unpredictable but fascinating terrain of the master's words. Amalgamating discourses and conversations from several yatras, it is a blend of the specific and the timeless. This book is not just about the Himalayas and yet, the book would never have happened without the Himalayas. The mountains play a vital role in the text, alternately as context and catalyst, mood and metaphor. Without them, some of the questions in this book would never have been asked. Even if they sometimes seem tangential to the line of enquiry, they remain a powerful subterranean presence, eventually becoming the very bedrock of this book
