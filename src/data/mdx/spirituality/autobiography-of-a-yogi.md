Autobiography of a Yogi is the story of the life of Paramahansa Yogananda (January 5, 1893–March 7, 1952) first published in 1946. Born as Mukunda Lal Ghosh in Gorakhpur, India, into a Bengali family, this book takes the reader on a journey into the life of Paramahansa Yogananda and his encounters with spiritual figures of both the East and West. Beginning from his childhood, his family life, to finding his guru and becoming a monk and establishing his teachings of Kriya Yoga meditation, this book allows the reader to see the spiritual yearning of the man and how he realizes that over the years. It draws on both his personal experiences—anecdotes and meetings with eminent spiritual personalities, his association with nineteenth-century master Lahiri Mahasaya who had prophesized the writing of this book—as well as how he travels across America lecturing and establishing his teachings in Los Angeles, California.
Autobiography of a Yogi is an introduction to the methods of attaining God-realization and emphasizes the value of Kriya Yoga and a life of self-respect, calmness, determination, simple diet and regular exercise. It has been in print for the last seventy years and has been translated into over forty languages. It has been highly acclaimed as a spiritual classic and is designated as one of the ‘100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century.’
