A series of intimate conversations with a wise and charismatic guru is a compelling idea. How many times have each of us wished for answers to life's deep questions? In Midnights with the Mystic, Cheryl Simone relates her personal experience of learning at the feet of Sad guru Valued, India's most sought-after mystic. As we share in her profound experiences, we are challenged to embrace the possibility that to each of us is available a higher realm of reality, a peak of consciousness, an entr√©e into the realm of freedom and bliss. "This book lays bare Sad guru's mastery over life." - Indu Jain, Chairperson, Times of India Group.
