"Pursuing your truth. Understanding this human experience. Embodying the divine is such an ongoing process of unveiling, adapting, and redesigning. The words in this book are the key to unlocking your truth, to see with no eyes, to hear the truth that lies in silence, and to connect with your inner wisdom. Thank you, Sadhguru, for such an enlightening creation, an offering to all seekers."-HRH Princess Noor bint Asem of Jordan

"This five-letter word that has baffled humans for thousands of years is finally explained in 272 pages. It's a compass for navigating life. Thank you, Sadhguru."-Jay Naidoo, Minister in President Nelson Mandela's cabinet, recipient of the Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur, France
<br/>
A much-used word, Karma is loosely understood as a system of checks and balances in our lives, of good actions and bad deeds, of good thoughts and bad intentions. A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living.
Through this book, not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives, he also tells us about the Sutras, a step-by-step guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process, we get a deeper, richer understanding of life and the power to craft our destinies.
