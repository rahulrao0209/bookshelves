Attributed to Valmiki, an ancient Indian poet and sage, Ramayana (the epic story of Rama), is one of the two great epic poems of India. Composed in Sanskrit sometime before 300 B.C.E., it makes for lively reading as a good adventure and love story as well as a guide to spiritual practice and a reflection of the cultural, social, and religious beliefs of India at the time.
