<h4>Bookshelves - A simple mobile web frontend UI built using Gatsby and Firebase.</h4>
<p><a href="https://bookshelves-9cbe3.web.app">Live Demo</a></p>
This is a simple proof of concept project that I built while learning Gatsby.JS. Its a user interface which shows a list of books based on the selected genre.
The books(images) are displayed in a swiper component built using Swiper.js. There is a dummy Google SignIn Auth built using firebase.
This is project is currently not responsive and has been optimized only for mobile viewing experience.

Stack - HTML, CSS(Styled Components), JavaScript, React.JS, Gatsby.JS, Swiper.JS, Firebase.
